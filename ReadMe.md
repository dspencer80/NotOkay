Hi there, I am David Spencer. For this app I have designed an app to be used by someone that is contemplating suicide. From the home screen, although in the very early stages, the app will allow you to enter someone's name and phone number into the app, which will be saved as an object in local storage, eventually, although the functionality isn't there yet, allowing you to click a button which will in turn contact up to 5 friends via sms text, alerting them you are in a bad place and need help. Furthermore, it is connected to an api which will import the names and numbers of crisis centers and the like to which you can contact if need be. For now I used promises to fetch from a fake api for the project to get the overall foundation for the app. 

REquirements:
In this app I used the following requirements:
--I used objects to store amd retrieve information that is displayed in the app
--I used a regualr expression to validate user input so the user would not input an invalid phone number.
--I retrieved data from a third party app, saved to JSON file, then converted to be displayed in a table.


To run app:
install npm from terminal
install node.js

Clone Repo at https://github.com/dspencer80/NotOkay

Open in live server
from there you can enter a name and phone number to be stored as an object
(Later I want to add the functionality to alert others)
(Just ran out of time on this one)
You can click resources which will take you to the information retrieved from the api
(used a fake one for this just to be able to import some data)

I know its nowhere near a finished product. I enjoyed it thoroughly though. I didn't have much time with work and family things but hopefully I did enough. I was afraid I would never catch on to javascript but upon doing this project it seemed to click later rather than sooner. It is fun being able to make text come to life and finally understanding how it all fits together. It took a little while to understand some of it but once you get the syntax kinda stuck in your head then it becomes easier. It just intrigues me how one little letter or , will throw your code off. I had a few moments of that. Searched for 25 minutes for an error to find out I left out a ; on one page. Overall i really enjoyed it and sincerely look forward to hearing from you.
